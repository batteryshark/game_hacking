Tank!Tank!Tank! (Emulated + No HASP + Banana Sandwiches) 

Notes:
- I haven't tested this on a VM yet, but it should work fine now that the proprietary OS crap has been removed.
- The only static modification to the binary is a change to the ld-linux path.
- You either need a webcam (preferably one that can do cropping), or disable it in the tank_emu.c file and recompile.
- If you have an I/O... use it. If not, use the tio_emu.so file as well in your preload.
- I left the landscape patch enabled by default, it may be cut off if you have a 1080p monitor or less, play it sideways if you really want.
- Tested and running natively on Linux Mint 17.3 (Rosa) x64

Instructions:

1. If necessary - change anything in the tio_emu.c file / tank_emu.c file and recompile them.
2. If you're using the emulated IO, the hook will try to open /run/kbdhook, find out what your kbd event
device path is, and run this after every reboot of your system:
    ln -s /dev/input/by-path/YOUR_*event-kbd /run/kbdhook
3. Run the game with LD_PRELOAD=./tio_emu.so:./tank_emu.so ./n_tank_release [window/rright/rleft]


Cheers!
