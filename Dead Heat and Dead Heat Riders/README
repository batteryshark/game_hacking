[Notes]
 - For network play, set an environment variable called DH_PCB_ID to 1, 2, 3 , or 4 depending upon link configuration.
 - If DH_PCB_ID is not set, the default PCB ID will be 1.
 - This game, like many other namco games, requires 5.1 audio at a rather specific sample rate. If you don't have surround51 as a valid audio device (i.e. you're like everyone with just two speakers, you're going to need to add export DH_SOUND_FIX=1 to environment variables and add this to your /etc/alsa.conf:
 
 """
 #5.1 to stereo downmix - manual with no plugin
pcm.!sysdefault {
slave.pcm front
slave.channels 2
type route # input output scaling
ttable.0.0 1 # fl left 100
ttable.1.1 1 # fr right 100
ttable.2.0 1 # rl left 100
ttable.3.1 1 # rr right 100
ttable.4.0 0.5 # ctr left 50
ttable.4.1 0.5 # ctr right 50
ttable.5.0 0.5 # lfe left 50
ttable.5.1 0.5 # lfe right 50
}

 """
This will push all 6 channels to your two speakrs. 
Note: Audio is sometimes testy; you may have to re-run the game a couple of times until audio works.

- If you don't have a camera (/dev/video0), turn off the camera in config.csv or you will get an error. If you have a camera and it still errors, export DH_CAMERAFIX=1,

- Check out data/csv/config.csv for extra options.
- Run the game with LD_PRELOAD=./dh_emu.so ./a.elf [-full]
