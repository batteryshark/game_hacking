[Patch Layout and Design]

Handling various parts of the game, a traditional single-file approach is waaaay too messy.
I've split everything up into base components to more easily read and edit:

* main.c: Entry Point - This performs all the static patching to the binary on linkage.

* global.h: Any external dependencies that won't fuck up some written function go here. Also, any game-specific
static defines, helper functions, or macros go here.

* rtfs.c/rtfs.h: Wraps the Raw Thrills FileSystem filename and streaming resolution.

* io.c/io.h: Wraps the Serial Gun interface and handles all input through its own POSIX thread.

* gfx.c/gfx.h: Wraps and handles any Graphical or Game Speed fixes.
